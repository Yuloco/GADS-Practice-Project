#in this lab, i will perform the following tasks:
    -   Activate Google Cloud Shell.
    -   Initialize App Engine.
    -   Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
    -   Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

#STEP1-Activate Google Cloud Shell:

#I listed the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list

#I listed the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list project

#STEP2-Initialize App Engine

#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region with this command:
gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

#When prompted, i selected the region where i wanted my App Engine application located by simply cloning the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

#STEP3-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

#Navigate to the source directory with this command:
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
sudo apt-get update

#To set up a virtual environment in which to  run my application i used this command: 
sudo apt-get install virtualenv

#when prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Entered:
virtualenv -p python3 venv

#To activate the virtual environment use this command:
source venv/bin/activate

#I Navigated to my project directory and installed dependencies with:
pip install  -r requirements.txt

#I then run the application with:
python main.py

#STEP4-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

#Navigate to the source directory with:
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application with:
gcloud app deploy

#If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
#Launch your browser with the command below to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
gcloud app browse

#Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
#using the project ID gotten from the command on step one line 13.
