#in this lab, i will perform the following tasks:
    -   Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface called VM-1.
    -   Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface called VM-2.
    -   Connect between the two instances.

#STEP1-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface called VM-1:

#To display a list of all the zones in my selected region, i entered this command:
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

#To set your default zone to the one you just chose, i entered this command:
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

#To create a VM instance called vm-2 in that zone, i executed this command:
gcloud compute instances create "vm-1" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"
--tags http

#STEP2-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface called VM-2:

#To display a list of all the zones in my selected region, i entered this command:
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

#To set your default zone to the one you just chose, i entered this command:
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

#To create a VM instance called vm-2 in that zone, i executed this command:
gcloud compute instances create "vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

#STEP3-onnect between the two instances:

#connect to vm-2:
gcloud compute ssh vm-2

#Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach vm-1 over the network:
ping vm-1

#Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on vm-1
ssh vm-1

# install the Nginx web server at the command prompt on vm-1:
sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

#Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

#Below is my custom message:

Hi from JUSTICE YERIMAH

#Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on vm-1, execute this command:

curl http://localhost/

#To exit the command prompt on vm-1, execute this command:

exit

#To confirm that vm-2 can reach the web server on vm-1, at the command prompt on vm-2, execute this command:
curl http://vm-1/
